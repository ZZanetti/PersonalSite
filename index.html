      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I have been programming for fun since I was 10 years old, and as a regular hobby since 2014. I have a BS in Applied Computer Science and a BA in
        International Affairs with a focus on Economics. With five years of professional experience as a credit risk analyst 
        in the commercial banking industry,
         I have developed critical skills like time management, teamwork, and organization that I bring with me to any new task. 
         I am passionate about data analysis and engineering. Please check out <a href="https://www.github.com/zzanetti">my GitHub!</a></p>

        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>
          I have built projects both professionally and for fun in a variety of programming languages including -   
            
              A intranet page for each department
                at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland using HTML/CSS/JS and hosted on SharePoint. 
              A web application deployed to Heroku called Outty that suggests outdoor activities for
               users based on their interests, location, and the weather using Flask/HTML/CSS/JS.
              
            A model website for a small furniture company known as Shop Dogg using Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/JS.

        <h3>Data Anlysis</h3>
        <p>
          I have been the primary analyst in charge of
          reporting on the feasability and risks of lending to various projects/businesses/individuals, including a $30 million real estate development project in Denver. 
          I have also built useful analysis models and frameworks to assist in underwriting credit risk. I constructed a framework for the valuation of
          non-traditional collateral in the form of airport concessions for a deal with aggregate loans of $27 million.   
          In addition, I have experience with multiple projects working on data analysis and statistics with Python libraries, SQL dbs, and Tableau.

        <p>Travel and Photography are two of my great passions that mesh excellently together. I have been lucky enough to capture beautiful nature shots everywhere from the North Shore, Oahu, Hawaii, to Telluride, CO, to Lake Garda, Italy.

        <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
        <p> Snowboarding is my favorite thing to do, especially with my dog! I have snowboarded all over the US, from New Hampshire to California. 
          My favorite resorts are Powder Mountain, UT, Jackson Hole, WY, and Vail, CO. 
          I am currently building a travel blog dedicated to snowboarding.
